Install:

-host: 			127.0.0.1
-database name: 	dayz
-user name:	 	user
-password: 		password

  2) dayz_data_mysql56_11_11_2014.sql 	(full MySQL database v5)
  3) dayz_empty_db.sql 			(empty MySQL database v5)
  4) dayz_empty_db_40.sql 		(empty MySQL database v4)
Every player in this databases have password: "password"
If you filled database with full data (#1 or #2), start to play!



Database filling:

-use next commands for database filling (from  the game):
/addspawn - add player spawn place in the place you are standing
/addcar - add car spawn place in the place you are standing
/adddot [type1, type2, type3 ...] - add object spawn place (see type id in 'thing_type' table in database) in the place you are standing
/upddot <type1, type2, ...> - add object types to the last dott created with /adddot command
/addobj <item id> [number] - add object in game (see id in 'things' table in database)
/setnew - set new objects you added with /adddot command on spawn places

The state and position of every (!) item in mode is tracked. So, the object count is static (if you don't add any one).



Editor:

You can add new types of objects in game. Files things.txt and imes.txt contains all information about things.
The rules for editing this files are inside them.
File things.txt contains parameters. File imes.txt contains name and description on several languages.
You MUST add description for every thing in imes.txt file! Every thing has three records:

[XXXXXXXXXXX]
ru {...}
en {...}
es {...}
[XXXXXXXXXXX_VALUE]
ru {...%d...}
en {...%d...}
es {...%d...}
[XXXXXXXXXXX_ABOUT]
es {...}
en {...}
ru {...}


where XXXXXXXXXXX - system name from things.txt (wich is in []). It contains only letters from the Latin alphabet and '_' char!
      XXXXXXXXXXX_VALUE - unit; must have "%d"; see patterns from this file
      XXXXXXXXXXX_ABOUT - description this thing
